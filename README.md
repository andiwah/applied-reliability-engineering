📘 Applied Reliability Engineering — Companion Resources

This repository contains datasets, templates, and computational resources accompanying the book:

Applied Reliability Engineering
From Failure Data to Engineering Decisions
Using Excel, Minitab, Python, and R

The purpose of this repository is to provide a hands-on environment where readers can reproduce analyses, explore reliability concepts, and apply methods to real-world engineering scenarios.

🎯 Repository Objectives

This repository is designed to:

support step-by-step exercises in the book

provide realistic industrial datasets

enable reproducible reliability analyses

serve as a reference toolkit for practicing engineers

evolve with additional examples and updates

The materials are structured to bridge theory and application, allowing readers to move directly from concepts to implementation.

Introductory dataset for reliability analysis in Minitab.

Demonstrates:

time-to-failure structure

censoring logic

probability plotting

distribution fitting

🧪 How to Use This Repository

1️⃣ Download the datasets corresponding to the chapter you are studying

2️⃣ Follow the step-by-step exercises in the book

3️⃣ Recreate calculations independently

4️⃣ Modify assumptions to explore sensitivity

5️⃣ Apply the structure to your own industrial data

Practical experimentation is strongly encouraged — reliability capability develops through application, not observation.

📌 Final Note

Reliability engineering is most powerful when concepts are tested against data.
This repository exists to make that process accessible, practical, and repeatable.

If these resources help you make better engineering decisions, then they have served their purpose.
